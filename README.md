PC1 Insufficiency Diagnostic

This repository contains the complete analysis code and figure-generation workflow accompanying the manuscript:

“Dominant Latent Axes Are Necessary but Insufficient to Explain Single-Cell Perturbation Responses.”

The goal of this work is to provide a falsifiable, distribution-aware diagnostic for testing whether a dominant low-dimensional axis (e.g., PC1) is sufficient to explain perturbation outcomes.
